Please open the HTML file to find a complete narrative report for this analysis. The rmarkdown file, fbClicksRMD.RMD, can also be opened 
in an R environment and run stand-alone to produce the HTML file here. 

# Project Summary
FreeCodeCamp provided data from posts on their facebook page. The dataset includes date and time the post was made, the type of post 
(whether it was a link, video, photo, or status), number of users reached, and user interactions (clicks or reactions). Matthew Barlowe 
provided the initial dive into cleaning and exploratory analysis. Here, I go a step further and examine the user reactions by facebook 
post topics.
