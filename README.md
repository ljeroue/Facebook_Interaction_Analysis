# Facebook Interaction Analysis
Please open the HTML file to find a complete narrative report for this analysis. Unfortunatly, you can't just click the document from
here. You will need to download or clone the repository, and open it from your browser (Once I've finalized this analysis, I will upload
it to a more perminate place on the internet). 

The rmarkdown file, fbClicksRMD.RMD, can also be opened in an R environment and run stand-alone to produce the HTML file here. The file, 
fbClicks.R is my "scratch pad" for the initial analysis prior to making it rmarkdown friendly.

## Project Summary
FreeCodeCamp provided data from posts on their facebook page. The dataset includes date and time the post was made, the type of post 
(whether it was a link, video, photo, or status), number of users reached, and user interactions (clicks or reactions). Matthew Barlowe 
provided the initial dive into cleaning and exploratory analysis. Here, I go a step further and examine the user reactions by facebook 
post topics.
